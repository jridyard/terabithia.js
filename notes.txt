- Duplicate the "callcloud" folder and change the paths
- Change the TERABITHIA variable in all files
- Add the content commands file to your manifest under a content script
- Add "terabithia/*" and "callcloud/*" (or w/e the new folder name is) to web_accessible_resources

Usage:
- window[TERABITHIA].execute({ command: "commandName" })
- you can also utilize helpers, I recommend using those for react events / react prop gathering
